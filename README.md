The task
shifts.csv
students.csv

Above are a couple of data files from the Hogwarts HR department. They need some statistics right away, but you can expect that they would like to get similar numbers monthly from now on.

Your task is therefore to

Put these data into a SQL database. If you don’t know which to pick, DuckDB can be a solid choice. Others are fine too.
Write a script which loads files like these into said database. You can pick whatever language you want. Expect that new files will arrive later. Every time, the files contain complete information. In other words, all the rows you get today you will get again next time + new ones.

Then run these numbers for Hogwarts HR. We’re hoping to get an order for a dashboard later. Please use data from the database, so we can move your calculations into the dashboard code later.

How much should be billed and paid as salary per month?
How many hours has each house spent cleaning pots?
